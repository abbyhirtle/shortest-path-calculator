This program utilizes the graph class to produce a summary table of the shortest paths from a starting vertext to every other vertex using Dijkstra's algorithm. In addition, the program checks for any cycles that exist in the graph using the recursive depth-first search algorithm. The input file consists a number of lines of three, semi colon separated values. The first value is a vertex, the second is another vertex, and the third is the distance from the first to the next vertex. The input file should be specified via the command line. Example input files are "ginfileX.dat".
